                    <ul>
                        <li>downloads the file paralell to the parsing of the html N reads the js file after showing the whole html filez</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>complier and interpreter</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Compiler reads the whole file then converts into low level language.</li>
                        <li>interperter reads it line by line and converts it to low level language.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>just in time compiler</li>
                        <li>complies the code while a program in running, as opposed to before.</li>
                        <li>reuses the previous code when used multiple times</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>at the beginning js is based on interperter model but for modern js it uses JIT complier (just in time).</li>
                    <li>Js is a single threaded language.</li>
                    <li>initially, js is a single threaded synchronousus based language, which blocks the other operations until current operations.</li>
